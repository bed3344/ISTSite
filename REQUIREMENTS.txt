Extras:

For this project I made several custom Windows forms that acted as dialogs for the more content heavy sections of the API.
This can be seen by clicking the buttons found in the Minors tab and the Resources tab. 
To do this I had to make three new Windows forms and make different versions of the Show() method for each one, 
some of the forms ended up having more than one Show() method based on what was needed for the content. 
I feel that this was a useful feature because it helped break up the large chunks of information, 
such as the resources section of the API and made it easier for the user to digest.

I also implemented several different ways that the user could interact with the data, 
such as choosing to load it themselves like the employment tables.
Another example of this is the ability to use a combo box to select a specific faculty member or interest areas in the 
research tab so that the user doesn't have to search through every single entry.

Overall, I feel that the design and interactivity of this project is thorough, intuitive and easy to use.
