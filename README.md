# ISTSite
This was a class project that is a replication of the information that can be found on the ist.rit.edu website in C#. The data is loaded into the program dynamically through the use of REST services from an API that was provided by the professor.

NOTE: The link to the Google Maps page does not work correctly. This map is loaded from the same API as the rest of the data, but this map is broken and I don't have the access to fix it.
